TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.

This code serves as a basic guide to getting familiar the Tensorflow jargon, and start implementing the Tensorflow on datasets.

Topics Covered

1. Introduction to TensorFlow.
2. Basics of Classification problems, and hyperparatemers involved in training a Neural Network.
3. Basics of Deep Neural Networks
4. Basics Implementation of TensorFlow Convolution Layer
5. CNN on MNIST using TensorFlow

After covering the above sections
